"""Reasoning signals derived from the score history.

The loop protocol tells the model to deduce structure from the previous rounds'
approach graphs, but everything the state block keeps is a pass/fail flag. Ten
questions a reasoning loop has to answer are therefore unanswerable from the
state as it stands:

* Was this round's prediction about the code right, or only its outcome? A
  requirement that fails after an edit looks identical whether the model guessed
  wrong about how the code works or implemented the right idea badly.
* Did the previous round fail the same way as the one before it? A model can
  rename its approach while repeating the identical mistake, and a name is the
  one thing the deadlock check is least able to see.
* Why is a run that looks finished not being allowed to stop? ``check_exit`` has
  a plateau rule that appears in no prompt, so a refused ``exit_ready`` is silent
  and the model spends its remaining rounds guessing.
* Which requirement keys changed? Scoring and deadlock clustering both match keys
  literally, so a renamed requirement leaves both without anything noticing.
* Did the change break something an earlier round had already fixed? Nothing
  compares a requirement's history against its latest value.
* Do the model's two descriptions of its own attempt agree? The approach graph
  and the approach sentence are written together and read by different code, and
  the deadlock check believes the graph unconditionally.
* And do the advisory notes still describe the brakes they mirror? Two of them
  re-implement protected logic, and nothing in the framework compares the two
  copies.
* Is the thing the last round said it would change actually there? The plan field
  is mandated by the protocol and read by nothing, and it is the only claim in the
  state block that can be checked against anything outside it.
* Do a round's own three claims about itself agree? A score entry carries a
  requirements map, a pass_count and an all_pass, and the two protected brakes
  read them separately, so an entry can stop the run and fail a requirement at the
  same time.
* Do the facts still say something true? They are the largest thing in the state
  block, they are written from memory, and a fact that cites a file and a line is
  the only claim here the code itself can refute.

This module computes all ten from the state the model itself wrote and renders
them as a bounded block for the round prompt. It adds no state, decides nothing,
and imports nothing from the rest of the package: ``runner`` imports the prompt
module, so importing the runner from here would be circular.
``check_exit`` and ``check_deadlock`` remain the only things that end a run.

The note renderers are pure functions over score dictionaries, in the same spirit
as ``evidence.py``, with two exceptions, both of them deliberate and both bounded.
The module reaches the runner through a lazy, failure-safe probe that checks the
advisory mirrors still agree with the protected logic they describe: a mirror
nobody compares is a mirror nobody maintains, and the one place a comparison can
survive the self-patch gate is here. And ``render_plan_note`` looks at the
filesystem, because the plan field is the only claim in the state block that can
be checked against anything outside it, and a loop that only reads what the model
wrote about itself cannot tell a real edit from a described one. Both probes are
written so that any failure means no note rather than no notes.
